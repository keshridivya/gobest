The aligners shift the teeth slowly and gradually and as a result, a person needs to change into a new set of trays after every 3 weeks. The new-age braces as they are called are worn for at least 20 hours in a day to get the maximum efficiency and better results. The aligners are either made of special material which use the gentle and constant force and move the teeth just like metal braces and brackets. Each set of aligners fit accurately over the teeth but should be removed while brushing, eating and flossing.--><\/p>\n<p>They are custom made for every person and designed to move teeth in the desired direction very very slowly. This is achieved by digitally capturing impression and processing the information using specialized software, where the future projections for better results and straighter teeth are computed and then the milling machine automatically custom fabricates the set of trays for you. On average, a person needs approximately 25-40 sets for complete alignment.<\/p>\n<p>The aligners come with an advantage i.e. they are very snugly fitting which over a period becomes virtually a part of the body and hence causes no speech problems. There are no restrictions on eating and drinking any foods as you will be removing them before every meal.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Difference between Traditional Braces &amp; Clear Aligners<\/strong><\/h2>\n<div class=\"aligners-table-wrap\">\n<table class=\"clear-aligners-table\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th align=\"left\"><\/th>\n<th align=\"left\">Traditional Braces<\/th>\n<th align=\"left\">Clear Aligners<\/th>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Visibility<\/td>\n<td>Highly Noticeable<\/td>\n<td>Invisible \u2013 One cannot spot them easily<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Removability<\/td>\n<td>Non \u2013 Removable<\/td>\n<td>Removable \u2013 People have freedom to remove aligners while eating, brushing &amp; flossing<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Oral Hygiene<\/td>\n<td>Difficult to maintain routine healthy Oral Care<\/td>\n<td>Since removable, it is easy to maintain routine healthy Oral Care<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Comfort<\/td>\n<td>Can cause abrasion in mouth<\/td>\n<td>Fits smoothly on the teeth<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Duration<\/td>\n<td>Takes longer than aligners(varies from case to case)<\/td>\n<td>Takes relatively less time than traditional braces(varies from case to case)<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n<\/div>\n<h2><strong>Care with Aligners on<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Though aligners are the most comfortable option, yet there are certain things that need to be kept in mind while you have it on. Your Orthodontist will give you a set of guidelines that should be followed diligently such as below:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>You should wear the aligners for at least 20 hours a day for the effective results<\/li>\n<li>Remove your aligners while brushing, flossing &amp; eating. Never have it on especially while consuming anything hot<\/li>\n<li>Keep your aligners clean. While you brush make sure that you brush your aligners in the same way<\/li>\n<li>Keep them safe in the box as given by your Orthodontist to prevent it from getting dirty<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><strong>Post-treatment care<\/strong><\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Retain your smile with Retainer \u2013 Just because you\u2019ve got your teeth straightened does not necessarily mean that it will stay straight throughout. Your Orthodontist might advise retainers which will prevent your teeth to shift back to their previous location<\/li>\n<li>Take care of your food habits \u2013 It may so happen that your teeth are sensitive after the treatment, therefore, it is advised to not consume, too crunchy food for a few days. Let your smile rest before going back to the crunchy munchy snacks<\/li>\n<li>Do not forget to brush \u2013 Keep up your habit of brushing twice a day and flossing in order to keep your teeth clean and healthy. Not taking good care of your oral hygiene will let the treatment go in vain.<\/li>\n<li>Visit your dentist \u2013 Because you are done with your treatment and have got that perfect smile you always desired for does not mean that you need not visit the dentist ever. Always visit a dentist after every 6 months to ensure that this smile remains intact.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><strong>Cost of Clear Aligners in India<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>The cost of Invisible Braces Treatment or Clear Aligner Treatment varies depending on the alignment of teeth and other factors that can be assessed by a dentist with a full mouth scan.
