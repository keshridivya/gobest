During this phase, people can face many issues which can be corrected by Braces. These issues include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Crowding \/ Haphazardly placed teeth can lead to poor oral hygiene and can also be the reason for Dental Caries (Cavities)<\/li>\n<li>Improper Bite that affects chewing efficiency<\/li>\n<li>Crooked teeth which can be a major reason for Periodontal problems such as <a href=\"https:\/\/clovedental.in\/specialties\/gum-diseases-treatment\/\">Bleeding Gums<\/a>, Halitosis (Bad Breath) and Tooth Mobility (Premature loss of teeth)<\/li>\n<li>If the teeth are irregular, then it can cause calculus deposits leading to yellow teeth<\/li>\n<li>Forwardly placed \/ Proclined Teeth which leads to more convex profile and posteriorly displaced chin<\/li>\n<li>Open Bite<\/li>\n<li>The spacing between teeth which can cause speech problems<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><strong>What is Mixed Dentition?<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>This is a stage when one has a combination of both primary and permanent teeth in the mouth is called Mixed Dentition.

Orthodontic treatment can be started as young as 7 years old. There is no upper limit in terms of age for Braces.<br \/>\nIf you have good oral health and firm teeth, you can get braces at any age.<br \/>\nThere is various kind of <a href=\"https:\/\/clovedental.in\/blog\/am-i-too-old-for-braces\/\">Orthodontic treatment available for all ages<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>What types of Braces are available?<\/strong><\/h2>\n<h3>Metal Conventional Braces:<\/h3>\n<p>These are the traditional and most common type of braces. The metal braces used today are much more comfortable and smaller in size. These require elastics which come in a variety of colors to tie the wire to the braces. The wires use your body heat to move teeth more quickly and less painfully. There is no age limit attached to these, as patients of all ages can choose to straighten their teeth using metal braces.<\/p>\n<h3>Metal Self Ligating Braces<\/h3>\n<p>These are metal Brackets with a shutter or lock system and do not require the use of elastic to tie the wire. In comparison to traditional metal braces, metal self-ligating braces are more comfortable and smaller in size. These are helpful in achieving arch expansion and minimize the need for extraction.<\/p>\n<h3>Ceramic Conventional Braces<\/h3>\n<p>Ceramic braces are the ones with clear brackets. They use tooth color and blends more naturally with your teeth. The shape and size are the same as metal braces. These are less visible on the teeth and as a result, are preferred by older teenagers and adults who might have aesthetic concerns. Sometimes, even the wires used are of tooth color which makes them less noticeable. Being less prominent, they require more care and protection compared to metal braces as they are larger and more brittle. They require extra protection, hence, are used more in upper teeth than lower.<\/p>\n<h3>Lingual Braces<\/h3>\n<p>Lingual Braces are heavy metal braces which are placed behind the teeth. These metallic braces can be made even of silver or gold. The individual Bracket is customized using CAD-CAM \/ 3D Designing. The treatment is highly aesthetic and less visible. This, however, can cause mild speech difficulties during the course of the treatment.<\/p>\n<h3>Aligners<\/h3>\n<p>Clear Aligners are medical grade plastic trays that do not require any braces or wire. They are totally invisible hence; the aesthetic concerns are duly met and make them very appealing with adults who need orthodontic treatment. Though placed inside they do not have any food restrictions associated. People believe that being placed on the inside, they might face speech difficulties; which is a myth. On the other hand, transparent braces are highly comfortable and hygienic. Clear Aligners also hide existing gaps.<\/p>\n<h2 class=\"ex_mr\"><strong>Cost of Braces and Aligners<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>The cost of braces and aligners completely depends from person to person depending on the teeth alignment &#038; multiple other factors. There is no standardisation of charges for braces and aligner treatment. At that first appointment, the dentist will examine you and take a digital scan of your cavity among other things. He or she will be able to offer you an exact estimate of the cost of the braces and aligners along with the duration of treatment based on this information. <\/p>\n<h2 class=\"ex_mr\"><strong>Post Treatment Care for Braces<\/strong><\/h2>\n<ul class=\"no_space\">\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/clovedental.in\/blog\/brace-teeth-healthy-mouth\/\">Brush &amp; Floss<\/a> twice a day to keep your teeth healthy. Healthy teeth respond better to the treatment.<\/li>\n<li>Visit your dentist on time for follow-up checks. Make a note of your appointments and follow suggestions, if any.<\/li>\n<li>Be patient.
