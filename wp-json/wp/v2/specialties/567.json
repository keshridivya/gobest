However, there are other reasons as well such as:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Smoking or <a href=\"https:\/\/clovedental.in\/blog\/the-dangers-of-tobacco-use\/\">chewing tobacco<\/a> which makes difficult for gum tissues to repair<\/li>\n<li>Consuming certain medications (<a href=\"https:\/\/clovedental.in\/blog\/taking-oral-contraceptives\/\">oral contraceptives<\/a>, steroids, anticonvulsants, calcium channel blockers, and chemotherapy) lessen saliva flow that protects teeth and gums. Some medicines even cause the abnormal growth of gum tissue.<\/li>\n<li>Crooked or misaligned teeth<\/li>\n<li>Hormonal changes such as puberty, menstruation, menopause, pregnancy etc. can make your gums sensitive and as a result prone to gum diseases.<\/li>\n<li>Certain illness such as cancer and HIV make your immune system weak are at higher risk of developing gum disease. Also, people who are <a href=\"https:\/\/clovedental.in\/blog\/having-diabetes-your-teeth-bones-are-reducing-and-you-dont-even-know-it\/\">diabetic<\/a> are more prone to get Gum Disease.<\/li>\n<li>Genetic susceptibility such as family history can contribute to gingivitis<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><strong>Symptoms of Gum Diseases<\/strong><\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"Standard\"><span lang=\"DE\">Bleeding of gums when you brush or floss your teeth<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"Standard\"><span lang=\"DE\">Pulling of gums away from the teeth<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"Standard\"><span lang=\"DE\">Teeth loosening<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"Standard\"><span lang=\"DE\">Change in the way your teeth fit together when you bite (malocclusion)<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"Standard\"><span lang=\"DE\">Pus between teeth and gums<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"Standard\"><span lang=\"DE\">Pain while chewing<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"Standard\"><span lang=\"DE\">Teeth sensitivity<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"Standard\"><span lang=\"DE\">Tender, red or swollen gums<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"Standard\"><span lang=\"DE\">Ill-fitting partial dentures<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"Standard\"><span lang=\"DE\">Foul breath that doesn&#8217;t go away even after brushing<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"Standard\"><span lang=\"DE\">Deep space formation between gums and teeth<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><strong>Stages or Types of Gum Disease<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p class=\"Standard\"><span lang=\"DE\">The stages of Gum Diseases are as follows:<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>GINGIVITIS<\/h3>\n<p class=\"Standard\"><span lang=\"DE\">This is the first stage of gum disease, caused due to the plaque build-up on gums. If the plaque is not gone after brushing and flossing, then it can cause irritation. In this stage, you will notice your gums bleeding while brushing and flossing. Because bone is not affected in this stage, the chances of recovery are quite high. <\/span><\/p>\n<h3>PERIODONTITIS<\/h3>\n<p class=\"Standard\"><span lang=\"DE\">Gingivitis if not treated on time, can lead to Periodontitis. This stage starts affecting your bone. Spaces are formed between bone and gum line as a result, bacteria will get a space food lodgement. If you visit your dentist on time then Periodontitis can be prevented. Periodontitis is an advanced gum disease.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>ADVANCED PERIODONTITIS<\/h3>\n<p class=\"Standard\"><span lang=\"DE\">This is the final stage of your gum disease where your bone is destroyed making your teeth loosen further. This can only be saved with surgery. And if the case is very advanced then even surgery cannot save your tooth, as a result, your dentist has to extract your tooth.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Treatment option of Gum Disease<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p class=\"Standard\"><span lang=\"DE\">The treatment option depends on the stage of Gum Disease. It also depends on your medical history and your overall health. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"Standard\"><span lang=\"DE\">The treatment options range from non-surgical therapies to surgical treatments. <\/span><\/p>\n<h3>The non-surgical options include:<\/h3>\n<h3>Deep Cleaning<\/h3>\n<p class=\"Standard\"><span lang=\"DE\">This is done in the very initial stage of developing a Gum Disease. Your dentist will remove the plaque or tartar (which hardens the tooth surface) from below and above the gum line. It is a preventive measure which helps you to save from getting gum disease. <\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Scaling &amp; Root Planning<\/h3>\n<p>This is also a deep cleaning process. The only difference is that your dentist will give local anesthesia to start the process. Plaque and tartar are removed from above and below the gum line and after that, the rough spots are made smooth. The process of smoothing helps to remove the bacteria. This is done only if your dentist finds that you have calculus deposits under the gum.<\/p>\n<h3>Surgical treatment includes:<\/h3>\n<h3>Flap Surgery<\/h3>\n<p>In this, incision is made on the gums to remove the tartar. Sometimes the irregular surface of the bone is smoothened so that there are no areas for bacteria which cause this disease can hide. This method is used to remove the gap between gums and tooth.<\/p>\n<h3>Bone Graft<\/h3>\n<p class=\"Standard\"><span lang=\"DE\">This method is used to regenerate the bone. The dentist use fragments of synthetic bone donated bone or your own bone which is used to replace the bone destroyed due to gum disease<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Soft Tissue Graft<\/h3>\n<p class=\"Standard\"><span lang=\"DE\">This method is used if the gums are receded. Gums are taken from the roof of the mouth and is stitched to the area of gum recession. <\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Guided Tissue Regeneration<\/h3>\n<p class=\"Standard\"><span lang=\"DE\">Done along flap surgery when bone which supports your teeth are destroyed. Your dentist will insert a small piece of mesh-like fabric between your bone and gum tissue. <\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Prevention of Gum Disease<\/strong><\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"Standard\"><span lang=\"DE\">Brush your teeth twice a day (with a fluoride toothpaste).<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"Standard\"><span lang=\"DE\">Floss regularly to remove plaque from between teeth. <\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"Standard\"><span lang=\"DE\">Visit your dentist after every 6 months for a routine check-up and professional cleaning.<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"Standard\"><span lang=\"DE\">Quit smoking<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><strong>Price for gum disease treatment<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>The progression and the location of gum disease are the main factors responsible for the difference in price for its treatment. Delaying gum problems not only affects oral health as a whole, it directly impacts overall health for instance, its directly related to increased risk of heart disease.
