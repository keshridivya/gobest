Make sure that they brush their teeth twice a day for two minutes each time, using up and down and back and forth motions.

This is an important tip: keeping a toothbrush for too long gives space for the bacteria to grow on the bristles.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong><b>Get Regular Cleaning<\/b><\/strong><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Your child must see their dentist every 6 months for a routine check-up and cleaning. Regular cleaning will help remove any plaque build-up that can lead to further issues like cavities. Another benefit of frequent check-ups is that the dentist will also take x-rays that will allow them to scan for any of the developing complications.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong><b>Getting A Fluoride Treatment<\/b><\/strong><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Fluoride treatments are a safe and effective way to maintain good dental health.

It\u2019s best to floss before bedtime to remove any food particles that may have remained in their teeth. If your child is finding it difficult to use traditional floss, there are lots of fun tools such as floss picks that can be used by them.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong><b>Eat A Tooth-Healthy Diet<\/b><\/strong><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">A diet leaves a big impact on dental health. Eating foods that are rich in calcium such as broccoli, leafy green vegetables, and dairy products results in healthy teeth and bones. Therefore, you should consider inculcating healthy eating habits.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong><b>Avoid Starchy &amp; Sugary Foods<\/b><\/strong><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Limiting your child\u2019s sugar intake is the best step to take care of dental health. When sugar gets on the teeth, it provides a food source for bacteria and this eventually leads to tooth decay as well as cavities. The longer sugar will remain on the surface of your child\u2019s teeth, the more bacteria can grow.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Now you can get expert solutions for all of your child\u2019s dental problems with Clove Dental.
