The bacterium called Porphyromonas gingivitis is responsible for this disease. The bacteria can move from the mouth to the brain, releasing the enzymes harming the nerve cells, leading to memory loss.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>Pneumonia\u00a0<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Poor care of oral health is likely to increase the risk of pneumonia. The natural bacteria occurring from your mouth can reach your lungs which may cause pneumonia and increase the risk of emphysema.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>HIV\/AIDS<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Dental infection is susceptible to people living with HIV\/AIDS. The mouth may be the first part that can be affected by HIV. Due to HIV, the immune system gets weakened, which may cause pain in the mouth and loss of the tooth.
