These implants are a safe choice for people who have lost one or more teeth as they bond with the natural bones and support the replaced teeth. They also have an additional advantage of allowing replacement teeth to look like a natural one.<\/p>\n<p>Getting the right treatment and doing proper cleaning for dental implants are keys to prolonging their appearance and usefulness.<\/p>\n<p>The following are some of the tips that if followed properly, will help you keep your dental implant clean and hygienic.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Tip 1 &#8211; Use a Soft-Bristled Toothbrush<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Soft bristles are less likely to hurt the gums or cause bleeding and are as effective as medium or hard bristles in extracting tartar and plaque. Also, electric toothbrushes are used to extract bacteria from the teeth more efficiently than manual toothbrushes because they produce a greater number of strokes than the human hand.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Tip 2 &#8211; Use a Water Flosser<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Often known as an oral or dental water irrigator, a water flosser disrupts and kills bacteria up to 6 mm deep. Many dentists prefer water flossers over dental floss since certain varieties of floss will discard particles that lead to peri-implantitis. That&#8217;s why make sure to use the water flosser so that it flushes out all the bacteria and germs from your mouth and keep it hygienic.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Tip 3 &#8211; Brush Twice a Day<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Brushing in the morning once you wake up prevents the morning smell and kills the bacteria that build up in your mouth overnight. Similarly, brushing in the evening before bedtime kills the bacteria that have accumulated during the day and decreases the risk of plaque build-up and decay overnight. Also, many dentists recommend brushing during a meal, or at some point of the day when food particles and bacteria need to be cleaned, especially, when you have dental implants so that they do not get affected anymore.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Tip 4 &#8211; Avoid Smoking And Drinking Alcohol<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Avoiding smoke and drinking is a good thing for your physical well-being. However, you must prevent these things while you have dental implants. Always remember that the dental implants take about 6 months to recover, so smoking during this time can be dangerous. Drinking alcohol has also been found to slow down the healing process of dental implants, so avoid this as much as you can.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Tip 5 &#8211; Use Crown &amp; Bridge Floss<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Crowns and Bridge floss are specially designed to clean under and over dental implants. It has two rigid nylon ends and a fluffy centre that softly cleanses the dental implant surface and the porcelain that reaches the teeth. The rigid ends help you to insert the floss between the dental implants in the gumline and pull it through to the other side. This way, all the fluoride spread across the implants, which helps avoid excessive bacterial growth.<\/p>\n<p>These are some of the tips that will help you keep your dental implants clean and hygienic.
