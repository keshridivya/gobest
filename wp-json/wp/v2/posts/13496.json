Let us find out as we debunk the 10 popular myths about the root canal.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>RCT is Painful<\/b> &#8211; RCT is not a painful procedure. The dentist will administer local anaesthesia to numb the entire area. It means you will not feel any pain or sensation in your tooth. Moreover, he will prescribe you pain killers and antibiotics to control any further inconvenience.<\/li>\n<li><b>RCT is Expensive<\/b> &#8211; RCT is not a prohibitively expensive dental treatment. Although the costs will vary according to the location of your tooth and the cost of the crown. Secondly, the total cost will also depend upon your insurance coverage.<\/li>\n<li><b>RCT is Risky<\/b> &#8211; There is no truth in this myth. On the contrary, RCT is the best dental<br \/>\ntreatment to save your natural tooth. Moreover, delaying your RCT can make you prone to several other health risks.<\/li>\n<li><b>RCT is not Necessary<\/b> &#8211; Many people believe that there is no need for RCT if it does not hurt. However, the absence of pain has nothing to do with the need for RCT. It has to be done with or without pain, and depends on your need for the procedure<\/li>\n<li><b>Tooth roots are removed in RCT<\/b> &#8211; Do you really buy this? RCT is a dental procedure in which the infected pulp of the tooth is cleaned and <a href=\"https:\/\/clovedental.in\/blog\/crowns-and-bridges\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">sealed with a crown<\/a>. It aims to restore the tooth roots and not remove it.<\/li>\n<li><b>RCT is a Time-Consuming Procedure<\/b> &#8211; There is no truth in this misconception. Ideally, RCT can be done in a single day only. However, the need for a second visit depends upon the extent of the condition and the recovery of the patient .<\/li>\n<li><b>Pregnant ladies cannot go for RCT<\/b> &#8211; Pregnant ladies should indeed avoid undergoing x-rays, but RCT requires an x-ray of mouth. These rays do not reach the abdomen, making it completely safe for pregnant ladies. Moreover, a lead shielding is often used during an x-ray when pregnant ladies come for a treatment.<\/li>\n<li><b>Crowns cause Root Canal Issue<\/b> &#8211; It is a false misconception that crowns cause root canal issues. It can happen even regardless of any tooth covering.<\/li>\n<li><b>Tooth Extraction is Better than RCT<\/b> &#8211; <a href=\"https:\/\/clovedental.in\/specialties\/wisdom-teeth-removal-extraction\/\">Tooth extraction<\/a> is the last option for a damaged tooth. Experts suggest that keeping a natural tooth is crucial for proper chewing and eating functions. RCT saves the tooth roots and safeguards the adjacent healthy teeth as well.<\/li>\n<li><b>RCT causes Illnesses<\/b> &#8211; Medical evidence shows that RCT has saved patients from severe brain and heart infections.
