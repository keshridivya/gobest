A solid oral hygiene routine and professional dental care are both important. But the same is true of a child\u2019s first teeth, even though they are eventually lost to make way for the permanent teeth. In fact, the neglect of a child\u2019s milk teeth and general oral health can have serious consequences that could last well into adulthood. Like vaccinations and health checks, regular dental check-ups must be an established part of childhood, starting at the age of 12 months.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-754\" src=\"https:\/\/clovedental.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/Milk-Teeth-II.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/clovedental.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/Milk-Teeth-II.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/clovedental.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/Milk-Teeth-II-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/clovedental.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/Milk-Teeth-II-768x512.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>Why is Professional Dental Care Important?<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Milk teeth are critical for chewing, speaking and a child\u2019s appearance. They also hold space in the jaws for permanent teeth.<\/li>\n<li>Milk teeth must receive proper professional care to prevent toothaches, cavities and severe decay.<\/li>\n<li>If decay causes the premature loss of a milk tooth, adjacent permanent teeth may drift into the empty space. This can cause crooked or crowded teeth and an eventual need for braces.<\/li>\n<li>Habits such as thumb sucking, tongue thrusting and mouth breathing can affect a child\u2019s teeth, the appearance of facial features, and cause speech problems. A dentist can address these habits before they lead to greater problems.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>Do\u2019s and Don\u2019ts of Dental Care for Children<a href=\"https:\/\/www.clovedental.in\/treatments\/pediatric-dentistry\/\"> (Pediatric Dentistry)<\/a><br \/>\n<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-755\" src=\"https:\/\/clovedental.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/Milk-Teeth-III.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/clovedental.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/Milk-Teeth-III.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/clovedental.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/Milk-Teeth-III-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/clovedental.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/Milk-Teeth-III-768x512.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>Do\u2019s:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Take your child to the dentist regularly from the age of 12 months.
