Mrs. Sobti visited Clove Dental clinic where she explained the symptoms which by now she is tired of explaining to every doctor.<\/p>\n<p>The dentist diagnosed full mouth, whole set of teeth and found that her teeth were misaligned. Due to small jaw, her teeth were not properly placed leading to crowding which was constantly triggering the headache all this while.<\/p>\n<p>She was a bit amazed as the treatment plan suggested by the dentist was quite simple and to a greater extent painless. She had to undergo a detailed orthodontic treatment after which not only she was relieved of her headache but got a beautiful smile. Her teeth were corrected which had a positive impact on her personality. She was more confident than before and loved her smile.<\/p>\n<p>Had she not visited a dentist she would have never known of any such connection and might end up undergoing open surgery which would have costed her pots of money without treating her chief complaint.<\/p>\n<p>Dentistry lacks awareness. People are not aware about even the basic dental problems which if not treated in time can lead to major health complication. Even the surgeons or physicist are unaware about the link between Oral Health and General Health as a result they end up suggesting surgeries without even knowing the cause.<\/p>\n<p>Your dental health is as important as regular physical health. It\u2019s not just about getting a cavity filled, it\u2019s about the overall health of an individual.<\/p>\n<p>By:-<\/p>\n<p>Lt. Gen.
