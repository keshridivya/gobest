No matter how well we take care of our teeth, they become discolored or yellowed. This may be because of the food we eat, the beverages we drink, tobacco use, aging, and more. That\u2019s where <\/span><b>teeth whitening treatment<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> really comes in handy. New things are always a bit nerve-wracking, which is why we\u2019ve put together all the benefits and the procedures regarding teeth whitening in this article.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Many people today are worried about their yellowish teeth and look forward to the treatment for getting a brighter white smile. This is what teeth whitening treatment is all about. Teeth-whitening is a process that targets the enamel and whitens teeth externally. If put simply, it whitens the teeth and facilitates a perfectly brilliant smile.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong><b>What Is Teeth Whitening?<\/b><\/strong><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Teeth whitening is a process in the field of cosmetic dentistry that can help in getting rid of the stains or yellowness on the teeth. There are various factors due to which our teeth generally tend to lose their brightness such as diet, age, and medical conditions. The enamel (the hardest substance in the body) which is the outer covering of the teeth is affected due to this.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">However, if you are wondering about <\/span><b>teeth whitening treatment price,<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> it completely depends on various aspects of the oral health situation of a person. You can consult your dentist and get the entire details of the price for the teeth whitening treatment.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong><b>Why Do Dentists Recommend Teeth Whitening?\u00a0<\/b><\/strong><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">There are various reasons and factors why your dentist has recommended teeth whitening to you. There are multiple causes that lead to a loss of tooth enamel. This loss makes the teeth appear yellow and dull. In this situation, teeth whitening is recommended.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong><b>Diet<\/b><\/strong><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Our teeth have to face uncountable changes in the intake of food right from sugary ones to alcoholic beverages. Our diet is one of the important factors that influence the appearance of teeth. Usually, food that contains caffeine like tea or coffee has a negative effect upon the teeth resulting in staining them.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong><b>Ageing\u00a0\u00a0<\/b><\/strong><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Age is also a major factor that can lead to yellow or <\/span><b>discolored teeth<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. As a person ages, the layer of enamel slowly decreases and this impacts the brightness of the teeth. Having other dental problems like cavities, plaque build-up, and tartar accumulation due to natural ageing also affects how our teeth look in some way.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong><b>What Is the Procedure Of Teeth Whitening?<\/b><\/strong><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Teeth whitening can be done either at home or at the dentist\u2019s clinic. Often one of the following bleaches is involved in teeth whitening products: Hydrogen peroxide or carbamide peroxide. These bleaches work on the outer enamel, therefore, clearing all the dullness or stains present.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Even though there is an availability of teeth whitening products in the market, they are not as effective as a teeth whitening procedure carried out at your dentist\u2019s clinic.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Another notable factor is that teeth-whitening can generally be performed by a dentist in only a single session whereas the at-home products will take a longer time and effort. A good dentist can definitely assure safety and proper care due to their expertise.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong><b>Dazzling Smile with Uncompromised Oral Health!\u00a0<\/b><\/strong><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Get the most advanced teeth whitening treatment at Clove Dental clinic and witness highly effective results.
