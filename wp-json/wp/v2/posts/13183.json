Getting a <a href=\"https:\/\/clovedental.in\/specialties\/wisdom-teeth-removal-extraction\/\">tooth extracted<\/a> is a long chain of events where you have to take care of the site of the extraction for weeks to come. This means taking care of brushing and cleaning the site properly, avoiding strenuous activities right after the extraction, and avoiding putting undue pressure on the site by sucking or smoking.<\/p>\n<p>However, the main objective of our teeth, and our mouth is to help us in consuming our food. There are certain restrictions that you have on what you can eat and cannot eat after having a tooth extraction. This article discusses these details- have a look!<\/p>\n<p><strong>How To Eat After an Extraction?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Your way of eating is just as important as what you eat right after getting an extraction. It is best to use the opposite side of the affected site in the mouth to chew and eat your food for a few days post-extraction. You may think that because you are going to be consuming a liquid diet, it will be better to use a straw. However, avoid the use of straw as the suction action may cause the blood clot to get dislodged and increase your healing period.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What Can You Eat?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>For the first 24 hours, liquid and soft food like mashed potatoes are the only things you can consume. Gradually, you can switch to normal food as and when you begin to feel comfortable with your situation. Yoghurt, pudding, applesauce, scrambled eggs, oatmeal, pancakes, and broth-based soups (without large meat chunks) are the best for you. However, make sure that you take them at room temperature and not scalding hot. Also, you can eat ice cream but without any crunchy or chewy candy pieces and avoid using ice cream cones.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What You Shouldn\u2019t Eat?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Completely avoid hard, crunchy and chewy food for about a week after the extraction. Even crispy and grainy foods are not a good option for your tooth extraction site as they may disturb the equilibrium of the blood clot on the operation site. You will also not be able to chew tough meats, which means that the only way to get your protein would be from dairy products. Also, avoid consuming alcohol until the time you are taking powerful pain medications.<\/p>\n<p>Tooth extraction can take weeks to recover from fully, even when everything goes in your favour. That is why it is crucial to maintain a strict regime of hygiene activities and eat only what suits the mouth in the time of recovery. In case of a problem or sudden pain, you must immediately revert back to soft foods and talk to a dentist at a reputed <a href=\"https:\/\/clovedental.in\/\">dental clinic<\/a> like Clove Dental.
