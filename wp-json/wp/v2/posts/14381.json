Once the nerves and pulp have been removed, the tissue in the tooth will dry up and become brittle. The dentist fills the gap and covers it with a crown to offer more strength to the treated tooth. This saves the tooth from further damage and cracks.<\/li>\n<li><strong><b>Dental crowns offer aesthetic looks<\/b><\/strong><br \/>\n<em><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/clovedental.in\/blog\/crowns-and-bridges\/\">Dental crowns<\/a><\/strong><\/em> add a final touch to the dental treatment like getting implants. It gives the impacted tooth both good looks and longevity. A dental crown can also be used to conceal a permanently discoloured or deformed tooth. Dental crowns are meant to blend in with your neighbouring teeth, so if you have a tooth that seems to be out of position, the line is restored with a dental crown.<\/li>\n<li><strong><b>Dental crowns offer the required dental support<\/b><\/strong><br \/>\nWhen you lose a tooth, dental crowns provide the support your replacements require. Following the insertion of the post into your jaw and enabling your bone to fuse it in place, a crown will be placed on the abutment to restore shape and function to your mouth. A crown holds and supports your dental bridge, allowing you to chew, smile, and speak comfortably.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Such are the reasons that would undoubtedly advocate the installing of dental crowns.
