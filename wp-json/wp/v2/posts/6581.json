Or , do I have adult patients walking <\/i><\/b><b><i>upto<\/i><\/b><b><i> me to get Braces ?\u00a0 <\/i><\/b><\/p>\n<p>There are ample reasons to consider orthodontic treatment at any age which could vary anywhere from getting mal-alignment corrected to getting a proud smile giving a moral boost to the patient. The factors that closely determine your candidature as an orthodontic patient is the state of your periodontal health , general health , extent of your malocclusion and not your biological age. Compromised general health such as cardiac anomaly , blood disorder , neurological disorder like Epilepsy, uncontrolled diabetes , etc may act as a constraint. Although a rare problem , but something to be mindful of during orthodontic corrections.<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><b><i>But what about the Bio-Mechanical constraints ?<\/i><\/b><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Growth and development of the orofacial tissues is completed in adults , making the adult bone less resilient to changes unlike in children between the age group of 9-18 years. The two primary bones of the face i.e. Maxilla\u00a0 ( upper jaw) and Mandible (lower jaw) are still undergoing growth making it easier for your doctor to redirect their growth if needed by use of certain appliances.\u00a0 All orthodontic appliances inevitably work in the same manner i.e. by application of light forces on teeth to move them into alignment by altering their movement through bone. The health of the gum tissues play a key role in keeping the optimal bone level.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><b><i>Orthodontic treatment outcome of Adults Vs Younger children ?<\/i><\/b><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Unlike children adults are more inquisitive about their treatment plans and the anticipated outcomes thereby keeping their orthodontists on their toes. In my practice , the primary reason an adult takes up orthodontic treatment is compromised esthetics yet demanding the treatment to be carried out in an aesthetically pleasing manner.<\/p>\n\n<p>Adults are more prone to root resorption while undergoing ortho treatment compared to children \u2013 making the treatment more challenging for an orthodontist<\/p>\n<p>Sounds blunt or maybe brutal but adults can afford them more easily than kids. All thanks to modern medicine and research , with wide variety of treatment modalities nowadays \u2013 we are on the verge of giving a customized treatment options. So it\u2019s only wincing at the thought of having a metallic mouth that\u2019s probably refraining them for walking upto me.<\/p>\n<p><u><i>Nevetheless<\/i><\/u><u><i> every patient deserves a healthy smile , so Let\u2019s be friends with braces\u00a0<\/i><\/u><\/p>\n<p>By:\u00a0Dr. Nikita Khillon<\/p>\n<p>Orthodontist, Clove Dental<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>As an orthodontist in practice for last 4 \u00bd years , I have been consistently providing braces treatment to teenagers keeping their chronological age as the onset criteria.
