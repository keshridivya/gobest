Let us know more about it in detail.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">What is a smile makeover?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">A smile makeover is a method of improving the appeal of your smile. It enhances your overall facial look through different treatment modalities involving cosmetic dentistry. Many factors are considered for a complete smile makeover, which is decided according to an individual&#8217;s needs and overall oral health condition.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Some of the factors considered are tooth color, the shape of a tooth, width of the tooth, alignment of the tooth with lips and other oral structures, condition of your gum tissues, etc.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Some of the common cosmetic dental problems and their solution<\/span><\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><b>Missing teeth<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">: Many of us have lost one or more teeth due to decay or other dental issues. Missing a tooth or more affects our smile and hence our overall appearance. Along with the appearance, it may cause some serious dental issues like bite problems or the position of adjacent teeth. The best way to replace a missing tooth is a dental implant or a crown. Both of them can give you a confident smile.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><b>Inappropriate tooth proportion:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> This includes the width and length of your teeth. Long teeth make your look younger and render you with a youthful appearance. Short teeth can be corrected by reshaping. Besides reshaping, composite buildups, dental laminates, or dental veneers can give you an appropriate teeth proportion. A cracked tooth or chipped tooth can also be corrected by these treatments.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><b>Alignment of teeth:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> Crooked teeth, overlapping tooth or spacing between the tooth, affect your smile. These can be treated with orthodontic treatment, using Invisalign braces. This will help you get back your natural smile.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><b>Gummy smiles:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u00a0 If your gums are extensively visible while smiling, this is known as a <strong><em><a href=\"https:\/\/clovedental.in\/blog\/gummy-smile\/\">gummy smile<\/a><\/em><\/strong>. It might not seem like a massive dental issue, but it affects your overall appearance. It can be treated by recontouring or reshaping the gums with the help of laser dentistry.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Smile makeovers are done for several reasons and can be customized according to your requirements. A cosmetic dentist will review your overall health and plan your treatment accordingly.
