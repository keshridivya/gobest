The contour of your lip dictates the smile curvature which you should have. In addition, your facial appearance, skin tone, hair color, teeth characterization (color, width, length, shape and tooth display) and gums are considered to develop an ideal smile. Clove is mindful of each unique client&#8217;s requirement and desire to have that perfect smile.<\/p>\n<h4>Tooth Color and Types of Fillings<\/h4>\n<p>Silver or metal dental fillings can be replaced with natural, tooth colored nanocomposite restorations, while teeth whitening can improve the color of stained or dulled teeth.<br \/>\nTooth color and shading are important considerations during the evaluation of and preparation for various procedures including porcelain or zirconia veneers, crowns, bridges, composite bonding &amp; dental implants.<\/p>\n<h4>Missing Teeth<\/h4>\n<p>One or more missing teeth can negatively affect the appearance of your smile as well as affect your bite and increase your risk for tooth decay. Tooth replacement by dental implants, bridges or partial dentures can be undertaken under expert hands to give youthful looks and improve chewing and speech capabilities.<\/p>\n<h4>Crooked or Irregular Alignment<\/h4>\n<p>Crooked teeth, overlapping or gaps between teeth can be straightened and aligned through Orthodontics, improved with veneers or aligners. These aligner trays are made of smooth, comfortable &amp; virtually invisible reinforced resins\/plastic that you wear over your teeth. They gradually and gently shift your teeth into place. You just pop in a new set of aligners approximately every two to four weeks, until your treatment is complete.<\/p>\n<h4>Harmony &amp; Balance<\/h4>\n<p>Uneven, chipped and cracked teeth can be cosmetically rectified for an improved appearance.<\/p>\n<h4>Fuller Lips, Smile &amp; Cheeks<\/h4>\n<p>An ageing look or sagging face can be improved or rejuvenated with certain procedures in the smile makeover category creating a fuller face and well-supported lips to create a younger look using least invasive procedures.
