Also known as wisdom teeth, these are actually a set of 4 molars that erupt in our mouth after the age of 17. However, evolution has also ensured that not all of us have the room in our mouth to adjust these wisdom teeth, and thus, they end up causing more trouble than they solve.<\/p>\n<p>This is why wisdom teeth are often removed from our mouth. If you are someone who has gone through a wisdom tooth extraction, you must know how it feels, and how much it took to recover from that. However, if you are someone who is about to get an extraction, here is what you need to know about recovering post a tooth extraction.<\/p>\n<h3>Tips for a Quick Recovery from Wisdom Tooth Extraction<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Keep A Check On Bleeding<\/b> &#8211; Slight bleeding for the first 24 hours is considered acceptable because you have just had a tooth removed. Try to sit upright and avoid any vigorous activity for a few days after the extraction. To control bleeding and maintain the blood clot that has formed on top, rinse<br \/>\nyour mouth first and then bite down on a gauze.<\/li>\n<li><b>Take Medicines<\/b> &#8211; Your medication is meant to help with the <a href=\"https:\/\/clovedental.in\/blog\/ignorance-dental-pain-bliss\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">tooth pain<\/a> and swelling that may follow after the extraction. Make sure that you are taking them on time and carry on with your daily life.<\/li>\n<li><b>Rest<\/b> &#8211; Rest is the best way to heal any problem that your body faces. Instead of rushing back to<br \/>\nyour routine and joining work again, take a while to recover first. Heavy exercise is not recommended at all while you <a href=\"https:\/\/clovedental.in\/blog\/tooth-extraction-aftercare-dos-donts\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">heal from tooth extraction<\/a> as the strain may cause the blood clot to move. Also, while you are resting, make sure that you keep your head elevated with pillows.<\/li>\n<li><b>Avoid Tobacco<\/b> &#8211; Tobacco, whether chewing tobacco or cigarettes, is bad for you especially after an<br \/>\nextraction. They slow down healing and can even cause a dry socket in the extraction site (when the blood clot gets displaced from the site).<\/li>\n<li><b>Stay Hydrated<\/b> &#8211; Hydration is the key to recovery when it comes to tooth extraction. Drink water and<br \/>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/clovedental.in\/blog\/eat-avoid-tooth-extraction\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">natural fruit juices after tooth extraction<\/a> as much as you can, however, with the exception of the use of a straw. Also, avoid caffeinated or carbonated drinks for at least the first 24 hours of extraction.<\/li>\n<li><b>Follow Oral Hygiene<\/b> &#8211; Do not forget about your oral hygiene routine just because you have had an extraction. It is all the more important for you to follow your oral hygiene routine now. Gently brush<br \/>\non the area of the extraction to keep it clean, followed by a simple rinse with an anti-bacterial mouthwash. However, do not brush, rinse, or spit in the first 24 hours of the operation.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Getting a tooth extraction is not an easy thing to go through as it takes quite a lot to recover from it.
