Let&#8217;s look at some of them which have very high acceptance<\/p>\n<h4>Clove Oil:<\/h4>\n<p>Clove oil is the most popular home remedy. It contains a natural anesthetic called eugenol, which numbs whatever it comes in contact with.Today, Clove is widely accepted as a reliable solution for dry socket and for relieving the pain and discomfort associated with various dental disorders.<\/p>\n<p>Use a drop of Clove oil and mix it with two drops of olive oil and apply to the aching tooth. Application of Clove oil numbs the affected area temporarily and there is a short-term relief which might last from a few minutes to hours depending on the extent of infection. Clove oil at times can make pain worse if it comes in contact with mucosa, tongue or other sensitive areas of your mouth, as it can cause a &#8216;burn&#8217; of the mucosa.<\/p>\n<h4>Garlic:<\/h4>\n<p>Garlic acts like an antibiotic, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria. You can use garlic in two ways. First, mash a clove of garlic, add a dash of salt and then apply this paste to the throbbing tooth. Second, pop a clove or two of garlic into your mouth and chew. Repeat this two or three times per day. The garlic may temporarily relieve pain, but it depends on what the cause of your toothache is. For example, if it is caused by Temporomandibular joint disorder, garlic may not offer any relief at all.However, you may find people backing away from you at the parties \u2013 noshing on garlic is a classic cause of bad breath.<br \/>\n<img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"509\" height=\"183\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-4206\" src=\"https:\/\/clovedental.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/IMG-8.jpg\" alt=\"Clove Dental\" srcset=\"https:\/\/clovedental.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/IMG-8.jpg 509w, https:\/\/clovedental.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/IMG-8-300x108.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 509px) 100vw, 509px\" \/><\/p>\n<h4>Peppermint Tea Bags:<\/h4>\n<p>Wet, used tea bags are often used to calm sensitive skin. Peppermint has numbing properties similar to cloves and is considered useful for treating pain. You can use peppermint tea bags in two ways. First, you can apply a cooled tea bag right on the throbbing area and second, you can put the tea bag in the freezer for a few minutes and, then apply it to the tooth. Keep the tea bag on the tooth for at least 20 minutes. There is anecdotal evidence that tea bags can lessen the pain. However, there is no long-term benefit, as pain comes back minutes after the bag is removed. A herbal method to relieve toothache will not hurt you in any way.<br \/>\n<img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"508\" height=\"193\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-4207\" src=\"https:\/\/clovedental.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/IMG-9.jpg\" alt=\"Clove Dental \" srcset=\"https:\/\/clovedental.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/IMG-9.jpg 508w, https:\/\/clovedental.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/IMG-9-300x114.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 508px) 100vw, 508px\" \/><\/p>\n<h4>Salt Water Treatment:<\/h4>\n<p>Salt water rinses are often used to clean an infected area, and for providing temporary relief. Swish a small amount of salt water or saline solution in your mouth for 30 seconds. You can repeat once or twice.The cleansing effect of the salt can get rid of some of the nasty bacteria or festering pus. Salt water rinses provide no long-term benefits. Salt water is all natural and, as toothache remedies go, one of the safest things you can do for your mouth.<\/p>\n<p>By:- Dr. Pragya Mishra<br \/>\nBDS, MBA<br \/>\nSenior Executive-Marketing<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>There have been many popular home remedies which are being practiced for many years for toothache.
