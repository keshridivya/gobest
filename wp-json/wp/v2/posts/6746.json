A word that bring lots of faces to our mind with which we have a lot of memories attached. But the question is \u2013 Who is a teacher? Is it just the face we remember? Or are they the ones responsible for who we are today?<br \/>\nTeachers are a ray of light in a child\u2019s life. He\/she is someone who shapes the life of an individual. We spend almost a quarter of our life in school amongst the teachers. So technically a child spends more time with his\/her teacher than parents. This explains that whatever learning children imbibe is from their teacher.<br \/>\nTeachers educate their students, make them to be good human beings, teach them moral lessons and are considered as stepping stone to success. But do you think the job is done?<br \/>\nIn this busy life health is something that takes a backseat, specially oral health. And as far as a children are concerned, they are more prone to dental diseases as compared to adults. This is because they consume more sugary food which results in dental decay or caries which can lead to other health complications.<br \/>\nIt is now need of the hour to impart the basic knowledge of oral health and the dental habits to be adopted to avoid any future implications. For that it is very important that the teachers are aware of the basic dental problems and solutions to it. They should be well trained about health education especially dental education.<br \/>\nSchools should organize dental camp for teachers in which they should be taught the primary dental habits which we are sure that they know but often forget to implement.<br \/>\nThe basic habits includes:<br \/>\n\u2022 <strong>Brushing twice a day<\/strong> \u2013 By now everyone is aware that it is really important to brush twice a day to keep your teeth healthy.
