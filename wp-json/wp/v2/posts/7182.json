Very few patients have this awareness, thereby, the negligence of the doctor goes un-noticed. The autoclavable Drill hand piece\/Scaler are expensive and if they have to be sterilised properly, the clinician needs extra sets of these expensive tools, to cater for the sterilisation cycle, after every patient, which is easily about 40-45 minutes. And hence an unsuspecting patient may never come to know what kind of infections he maybe exposed to if the dental clinic is not following the 4-step sterilisation stringently. <\/span><\/p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"font-size: large\">Clove takes pride in maintaining highest degree of asepsis and sterilisation similar to what is followed in the best USA practices and guarantees \u2018Zero Infection clinics\u2019, certified by the spore testing laboratory of Mumbai certifying month on month, that every Clove Clinic is \u2018Free from Infection\u2019.<\/span><\/p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">By:-<br \/>\nLt.
