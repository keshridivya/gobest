They replace the tooth from the very root, thus replicating its function in the mouth thoroughly. Plus the fact that they come in a variety of sizes, shapes, and heights make them even more desirable than other means of replacing teeth in people.<\/p>\n<p>While a single tooth implant is a common treatment for many, did you know that there are actually more than 1 kinds of dental implant? No, right? To help you understand the different types of dental implants and choices you have when it comes to replacing your missing tooth\/teeth, here are all types of dental implants and procedures.<\/p>\n<h3>Types of Dental Implants<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Endosteal<\/b> &#8211; The most commonly used type of dental implant, endosteal implants are made of titanium and are a small screw-like structure that is placed directly into the jaw bone. They can easily hold one or more artificial teeth.<\/li>\n<li><b>Subperiosteal<\/b> &#8211; When the bone density is not enough to hold the implant in place due to an underlying condition or due to delay in getting an implant, a subperiosteal implant is used. It is placed under the gums but on or above the jaw bone.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Procedures of Dental Implant<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Single Tooth Replacement<\/b> The most common form of tooth replacement is a single tooth replacement with a dental implant. A single implant is used with a dental crown to closely replicate a natural tooth.<\/li>\n<li><b>Multiple Tooth Replacement<\/b> There are many cases where there are multiple <a href=\"https:\/\/clovedental.in\/blog\/never-ignore-a-missing-tooth\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">teeth missing<\/a> that need to be replaced. In this case, implant-supported bridges are used in the mouth.<\/li>\n<li><b>Full Teeth Replacement<\/b> When a person is missing all their teeth, a complete edentulous arch is used. 4 to 6 implants are placed in the mouth to support a full mouth denture that helps in restoring the normal balance in your mouth.<\/li>\n<li><b>Ridge Modification<\/b>Some patients have a bony defect in their mouth, which is a way of saying that they don\u2019t have enough bone in their mouth. The implantologist lifts up the gums from the ridge and fills the space with bone or a bone substitute to help build up the ridge. This is ridge modification, a procedure that helps support the implant when it is placed in the mouth.<\/li>\n<li><b>Sinus Augmentation<\/b>To place an implant in the maxillary posterior region with a maxillary sinus is quite a challenging task. To curb this, the sinus floor is lifted with the bone to easily place the implant. This procedure is called a sinus lift or sinus augmentation.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>As a patient, it is your right to understand what you are up for whenever you go in for a procedure. Knowing your options helps you prepare for a better outcome and helps you in understanding what you should be expecting from your <a href=\"https:\/\/clovedental.in\/specialties\/dental-implant\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">tooth implant procedure<\/a>.
