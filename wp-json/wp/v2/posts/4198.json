It also lowers the rate of successful dental implant procedures.<\/p>\n<h4>Oral Cancer:<\/h4>\n<p>The risk of developing oral cancer increases when smoking is combined with heavy drinking.Oral cancer begins as a white or red patch in the mouth accompanied by burning sensation, senstivity to chillies, difficulty in chewing or swallowing and inability to open your mouth fully.
