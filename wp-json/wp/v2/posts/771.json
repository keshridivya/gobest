They give the\u00a0 face shape, fullness and structural support. In cases of \u2018Bite Collapse\u2019, what occurs with people without teeth as seen in old age, cheeks lose support and start to sag inwards giving an \u2018Old look\u2019 even to a younger person. Teeth also help in digestion. It is important to chew properly so that the digestion remains proper, but without teeth that becomes difficult. Teeth also help in keeping the jaw bones intact and in shape. Once teeth start to fall, the bone starts to resorb, in some cases it becomes dangerously thin and prone to fracture. Presence of teeth keep the bone under continuous functional stress due to masticatory forces within physiological limits.<\/p>\n<p>Also read: <a href=\"https:\/\/clovedental.in\/blog\/oral-health-do-we-really-care\/\">https:\/\/clovedental.in\/blog\/oral-health-do-we-really-care\/<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Teeth also help in proper articulation, the tongue touches the front teeth and the palate to pronounce \u2018th\u2019 sound which includes words like that, thin, then, three, both, worth, etc. Other sounds produced are C, F, L, S, V. The front teeth also help in aesthetics, which these days has become a prime concern.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, teeth help you to chew on your favorite food like different types of nuts and carrots and who doesn\u2019t relish that chocolate with fruits and nuts in it?
