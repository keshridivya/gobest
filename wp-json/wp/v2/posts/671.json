Normally the body&#8217;s natural defenses and good oral health care, such as daily brushing and flossing, can keep these bacteria under control. However, without proper oral hygiene, bacteria can reach levels that might lead to oral infections, such as tooth decay and gum disease. In addition, certain medications \u2014 such as decongestants, antihistamines, painkillers and diuretics \u2014 can reduce saliva flow. Saliva washes away food and neutralizes acids produced by bacteria in the mouth, helping to protect you from microbial invasion or overgrowth that might lead to disease. Studies also suggest that oral bacteria and the inflammation associated with periodontitis \u2014 a severe form of gum disease \u2014 might play a role in some diseases. In addition, certain diseases, such as diabetes and HIV\/AIDS, can lower the body&#8217;s resistance to infection, making oral health problems more severe.<\/p>\n<p>Periodontal disease has been associated with a number of systemic conditions. Though the biological interactions between oral conditions such as periodontal disease and other medical conditions are still not fully understood, it is clear that major chronic diseases \u2013 namely cancer and heart disease \u2013 share common risk factors with oral disease. Recognition that oral health and general health are interlinked is essential for determining appropriate oral health care programmes and strategies at both individual and community care levels. That the mouth and body are integral to each other underscores the importance of the integration of oral health into holistic general health promotion.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Common Risk Factors for Oral Health<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Oral disease is the most widespread chronic disease, despite being highly preventable.
