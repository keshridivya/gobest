But let\u2019s face it, most of us have yellow teeth. No matter how hard we try brushing to get that smile, which can win a million hearts, it doesn\u2019t happen. Sparkling teeth boost one\u2019s confidence and self-esteem and making a person to leave a mark in society. Yellower teeth make a person shy who will not smile fully and usually puts a hand in front of their mouth while smiling. With advancements in teeth whitening and introduction of other alternatives like ceramics, nobody needs to suffer in silence?<\/p>\n<h3>What causes tooth discoloration?<\/h3>\n<p>Even if a person is not ingesting tobacco, many daily products such as tea and coffee cause staining. As age advances, stains become deeper and harder to remove just by scaling. With age, the outer layer called Enamel wears out exposing the inner layer Dentin which can easily take up colour of various spices we Indians are fond of! Major spice such as turmeric can stain teeth yellow and if there are fillings in front teeth they become very conspicuous. Apart from that many herbal products, medicinal mouthwashes such as Chlorhexidine if used for prolonged time also cause staining.<\/p>\n<h3>Effectiveness of teeth whitening<\/h3>\n<p>To have a sparkling attractive white smile to boost one\u2019s confidence, teeth whitening (or bleaching as it is commonly known as) preceded by scaling and polishing may sound like a good idea. An important factor to discuss is whether teeth whitening is meant for you or not? Where is, the teeth whitening effective and where is it least effective? There is a continuous generative and degenerative process taking place in the body to which teeth are no exception. But with age, this process of degeneration gets enhanced and tooth structure wears off faster and its natural white shade is lost. Once that happens the whitening\/bleaching agents may hardly affect the shade of tooth at all.<\/p>\n<h3>Consulting your dentist for teeth whitening (WHEN?)<\/h3>\n<p>Most importantly you must consult your dentist before making assumptions about teeth whitening. On your dental visit, it is important for you to understand the treatment process and ask all the relevant questions such as \u2013 Will it be effective for my teeth? How effective is the procedure and how many shade lighter teeth will become? How long will it last? What type of whitening agents are you using and if there are better agents with better results available in the market? What are side effects of teeth whitening, etc. Being ready with all your doubts and putting them forward is as important as anything and helps us everywhere in life. So, don\u2019t hesitate to ask even the silliest question to your dentist before going for the procedure.<\/p>\n<p>Also read: <a href=\"https:\/\/clovedental.in\/your-teeth\/oral-health-care-starts-early-never-stops\/\">10 Simple Dental Health Tips to Maintain Oral Hygiene<\/a><\/p>\n<h3>Teeth Whitening procedure (HOW?)<\/h3>\n<p>There are two main types of procedures that can be done:<\/p>\n<p>1) In-office bleaching<\/p>\n<p>2) Home bleaching<\/p>\n<h4>In-office bleaching<\/h4>\n<p>As evident from the name itself, in-office bleaching is teeth whitening procedure that\u2019s done in the dental office.
