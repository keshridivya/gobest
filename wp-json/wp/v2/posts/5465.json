Clich\u00e9, some of you may say.<\/p>\n<p>Well, as clich\u00e9d as this may sound, we all want to hear this compliment at least once from our significant other. We want to have a pearly white smile that can make our date gawk specially when it&#8217;s valentines. Lasting impressions matter, after all.<\/p>\n<p>But for how many of us does this really come true?<\/p>\n<p>A beautiful smile doesn\u2019t come naturally to all. Some of us have to work hard for this (just like everything in life, duh!)<\/p>\n<p>With valentines down the lane you might want to look your best for that special someone. Looking best does include that smile to die for.<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s how you can get a smile that can kill (or at least keep them hooked) \u2013<\/p>\n<p>1. <strong>Workout Those Muscles<\/strong> \u2013 Try facial yoga. Believe it or not, working out your face muscles can go a long way in getting you an attractive smile. Facial exercises can strengthen and firm these muscles, and increase blood flow, blow your cheeks and hold. What\u2019s more? You appear younger and healthier.<\/p>\n<p>2. <strong>Let Your Lips Do the Talking<\/strong> \u2013 Pretty lips aren\u2019t just about ornate beauty \u2013 they can make a difference in your smile. If you want a smile that kills, it\u2019s important to take care of your pout. Drink lots of water \u2013 at least 2 liters a day. This will help heal chapped lips. Swear by your lip balm, or coconut oil if you want to go the natural way. To keep your pout supple and plump, mix some brown sugar with coconut oil and rub your lips with the mixture each night before bed to stimulate blood flow and remove dry skin.<\/p>\n<p>3. <strong>Take Care of Your Teeth<\/strong> \u2013 You can\u2019t ignore oral health. Healthy teeth and gums can impact your smile in a big way. Stained, yellow teeth or swollen gums are a big no-no. Blade pigmented gums are a further dampener. While basics like brushing twice a day or flossing can\u2019t be ignored, there\u2019s more to oral healthcare. For instance, to avoid staining you must rinse &amp; gargle regularly.<\/p>\n<p>4. <strong>Fresh Breath \u2013 Check<\/strong> \u2013 Even &#8216;Shrek&#8217; knew the importance of fresh breath, why can\u2019t you! Bad breath can make you lose your dates, friendships, opportunities, and happiness. There are a lot of ways to keep your breath fresh such as drinking plenty of water, eating apples, and cleaning your tongue regularly. Gargling after meals also helps. Check your mouth odor frequently. Simplest way is to lick your back of the hand couple of times, let it dry and then smell it.<\/p>\n<p>5. <strong>Make Dentist your Friend<\/strong> \u2013 Your dentist is your best friend, the one who can literally make you smile out loud. You can\u2019t take care of all your oral problems yourself, let the experts do their job. So share with him your problems.<\/p>\n<p>Wearing a perfect smile to a &#8216;Date&#8217; is as important as wearing the perfect outfit. Every smile tells a tale. Let yours tell a happy one!<\/p>\n<p>By:-<br \/>\nDr. Shalley Batta Rishi<br \/>\nBDS<br \/>\nZonal Clinical Head<br \/>\nCentral West Delhi, Clove Dental<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>\u201cYour smile lights up my Life\u201d Aww!
