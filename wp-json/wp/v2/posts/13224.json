Taking tooth extraction aftercare can provide you relief from the extreme pain and help you heal properly.<\/p>\n<p><img style=\"margin: 0 auto\" src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/extraction1.png\" alt=\"Tooth Extraction\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Here are some do\u2019s and don\u2019ts that you must follow to ensure a speedy and safe recovery after you have undergone tooth extraction.<\/p>\n<h4>The Do\u2019s<\/h4>\n<ol>\n<li><strong> Don\u2019t Eat or Drink Immediately<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Dentists advise refraining from eating immediately after tooth extraction. It takes time for the blood clot to form around the extraction site. Hence, it is wise to avoid eating, drinking and talking immediately after surgery. Post 45 minutes, you eat an ice cream without nuts or have cold milk.<\/p>\n<p><img style=\"margin: 0 auto\" src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/extraction2.png\" alt=\"Tooth Extraction\" \/><\/p>\n<p>If you feel thirsty- never use a straw to drink water. Start with soft bland diet for the first few hours following the surgery.<\/p>\n\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li><strong> Use cotton gauge to Stop Bleeding<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>There is going to be some amount of bleeding, and your dentist will ask you to keep a gauze pad for at least 45 minutes after the extraction is complete. In case the bleeding is a little heavier, it is okay to bite down on the gauze pad. The pressure will help stop the bleeding.<\/p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li><strong> Use ICE Packs<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><img style=\"margin: 0 auto\" src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/extraction3.png\" alt=\"Tooth Extraction\" \/><br \/>\nWhile you may feel no pain after a tooth extraction, more often than not, it is due to insensitivity from anaesthesia. Also, you might experience some swelling around the extraction site later.<\/p>\n<p>Swelling and pain may follow after complex extractions. In such cases, an ice pack can help you to not just reduce swelling but also check the pain. You must apply an ice pack to the outside of the mouth for 15-20 minutes.<\/p>\n\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li><strong> Brush Gently<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><img style=\"margin: 0 auto\" src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/extraction2.png\" alt=\"Tooth Extraction\" \/><br \/>\nBrush your teeth gently and avoid brushing around the extraction. Normally a blood clot forms around the extraction within hours following the extraction. The pressure that you apply while brushing might dislodge the blood clot and cause complications. Hence, brush carefully and as gently as possible to prevent dislodging the blood clot.<\/p>\n\n<h4>The Don&#8217;ts<\/h4>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Avoid<\/strong><strong> Smoking<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n<p>Smoking following a tooth extraction can be an invite to a host of complications. Not only can it weaken the blood, but it can also cause dry sockets to form around the extraction site within just a few days.<\/p>\n\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li><strong> Stay Away From Eating Solids<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n<p>As long as their numbness around the extraction south, stay away from eating food that requires a good amount of bite force. This may cause damage to the blood clot or the extraction site without you even knowing about it. Ideally, dentists say you must eat solids only after 4-5 hours of extraction.<\/p>\n\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li><strong> Do Not Take Aspirin <\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>If you feel the swelling is too much and painful as well, contact your dentist. Don&#8217;t take painkillers, especially Aspirin, as it can delay blot clot formation around the extraction site.<\/p>\n\n<p>These are some of the Do\u2019s and Don&#8217;ts that you must follow after you have had a tooth extraction. If you have had a tooth extraction recently and worried that your bite force and appearance may not be the same as before, then dental implants are a cost-effective long term solution.
