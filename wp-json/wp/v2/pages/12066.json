N-95 masks, scrubs, surgical gowns, face shields, eye goggles, caps, etc., ensure that there is no cross-contamination between patients, thereby ensuring patient and staff safety at all times.<\/p>\n<div class=\"inner-contentbox\">\n<h3>Aerosol Reducing &amp; Air Purifying External High Vacuum Apparatus<\/h3>\n<p>Special equipment for reducing Aerosol has been installed. High suction strength coupled with special filters like the high fibre Cotton filter, fibre glass filter, HEPA (H13) filter and activated carbon filters will be affective in minimising the COVID virus from the aerosol. UV light chamber within this new Aerosol Reducing unit will provide absolute clean environ to surgery.<\/p>\n<h3>UV Light Disinfection Cabinets<\/h3>\n<p>Germicidal \u201cUV light UV-C\u201d &amp; \u201cfar-UVC light and UVC light\u201d with a nm range of 200-280 or lesser are extremely effective disinfectant agents. Cash, pipes\/tubes and other belongings are sterilized using UV light fitted in the cabinets in every clinic. UV light has been researched to kill virus and other pathogens very effectively.<\/p>\n<h3>Formalin Disinfection Chamber<\/h3>\n<p>Formalin or Formaldehyde is an effective chemical which is used to sterilize items and equipment which are prone to damage from Steam sterilization such as Autoclave. It has been used for sterilization of plastics, syringes, needles, small scissors, instruments, plaster models, impressions, or articles which cannot be autoclaved &amp; used for external contact items only.<\/p>\n<h3>Disposable Gloves<\/h3>\n<p>Hands are properly sanitised and dried before donning gloves. A new pair of gloves is worn for every patient. Gloves are even changed if they appear to be contaminated during the treatment.<\/p>\n<h3>Face Masks<\/h3>\n<p>Face masks are designed to guard against splatters and aerosols from getting into contact with the mucous membranes of the nose and mouth. N95\/KN95 masks along with 3 ply Surgical Masks are used basis the type of treatment being done. All patients are given a Face Mask, in case they do not have their own.<\/p>\n<h3>Protective Eyewear<\/h3>\n<p>Protective eyewear is worn by doctors whenever there is a possibility that a patient&#8217;s body fluids may splash or spray onto the face\/eyes or an aerosol is being formed. Protective Eyewear is sanitised\/sterilised after every use.<\/p>\n<h3>Face Shields<\/h3>\n<p>Face shields offer reasonably good protection against splatters &amp; aerosols from entering the nose and are therefore used in conjunction with face masks. Face Shields are also sanitised\/sterilised after every use.<\/p>\n<h3>Protective Clothing<\/h3>\n<p>Protective clothing such as Scrubs prevent contamination of underlying clothing and protects from exposure to blood and body substances. Scrubs are worn by all Doctors in the morning and taken off for washing and disinfection at the end of the day.<\/p>\n<h3>Surgical Coverall\/Gowns<\/h3>\n<p>Gowns are critical elements of the PPE since they are the second-most-used piece of PPE, following gloves. No dental procedure is taken up without donning the surgical gown.<\/p>\n<h3>Disposable Caps<\/h3>\n<p>These completely cover the hair and used by all Doctors and Dental Assistants. They are also useful in keeping aerosols from lodging on the hair, which may then be transferred to family members or onto inanimate objects.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Clove Dental now has extensive PPE (Personal Protective Equipment) for all Dentists and Dental Assistants.
