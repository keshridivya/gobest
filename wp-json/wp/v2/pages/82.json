Every millimeter counts to give you that beautiful million dollar smile. It\u2019s a science of precision done intricately.<\/p>\n<p>Sometimes visiting a dentist and having artificial teeth or veneers does not give you that beautiful smile you have been looking for. Or many times a dental procedure does not give you the desired results, because dentistry is a fine blend of clinical skill, knowledge, aptitude and judgment where precision matters to a fraction of a millimeter, so much so that modern day dentistry requires use of microscopes, however the intense training received by a dentist involves achieving high levels of precision consistently over a period of time, factoring various variables including uncooperative patients, anatomical variations and also taking into consideration systemic diseases and co-morbidities which may influence treatment plan.<\/p>\n<p>And because dentistry is a professional branch and requires finesse, it becomes mandatory to get the treatment from someone who understands the treatment required and not from a quack or fly by night operators whose every and only treatment option is \u2018tooth extraction\u2019 or \u2018complete dentures\u2019 which will only further lead to many problems. Such so called dentists or quacks can also never understand what challenges a medically compromised patient can face or how important exposed root coverage of just a few millimeters becomes in case of sensitivity. A treatment done with skill and knowledge provides better and long lasting results.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>DENTISTRY IS AN ART \u2013 VERY INTRICATE!
