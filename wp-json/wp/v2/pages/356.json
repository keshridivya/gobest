Clove Dental takes every possible step to prevent cross contamination and protect the health of our patients. The heightened emphasis on hygiene at Clove Dental clinics ensures the well-being of our patients at all times.\n\n<strong><u>We follow a strict protocol for clinical hygiene and safety that kicks in before patients even enter the operatory<\/u><\/strong>\n\n\n<ol>\n \t\n\n<li>Patients are asked to cover their footwear with our shoe covers before entering the operatory.<\/li>\n\n\n \t\n\n<li>Instruments are sterilized in a four-step process that includes:\n\n\n<div class=\"under-list\">\n\nManual cleansing to remove deposits and residue.\n\nSterilization in an ultrasonic cleaner which operates at different frequencies, depending on the type of instrument being sterilized.\n\nA solution (5% dodecyl-dipropylene-triamine &amp; trialkyl ethoxy-ammonium-proclinate) is used in this step.\n\nPackaging in sealed pouches after instruments are dried\n\nCapturing the date of packaging &amp; expiry date of the sterilized instruments in sealed pouches\n\nPlacement of sealed pouches in an autoclave that uses pressurized heat to guarantee 100% sterilization.\n\n<\/div>\n\n<\/li>\n\n\n \t\n\n<li>All surfaces that patients come into contact with are covered with a cling film and changed after each treatment.<\/li>\n\n\n \t\n\n<li>Our dental chairs are cleaned with isopropyl alcohol and chlorhexidine spray.<\/li>\n\n\n \t\n\n<li>Doctors and dental assistants wear disposable masks, gloves and shoes that are allowed to be worn only in the clinic.<\/li>\n\n\n \t\n\n<li>Doctors and dental assistants are tested and immunized against all communicable diseases.<\/li>\n\n\n \t\n\n<li>Doctors and dental assistants undergo extensive training in sterilization protocols.<\/li>\n\n\n \t\n\n<li>Clinic audits are conducted regularly to ensure that protocols for sterilization and hygiene are followed thoroughly and consistently.<\/li>\n\n\n \t\n\n<li>Our patients are seated in unique dental chairs that are equipped with retractable valves; the valves prevent the backflow of oral fluids into the chair tubing.
